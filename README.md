# Combat Utility Belt **Beta**
 Every DM hero needs gadgets to keep their game safe from players up to no good!

 And where better to store those gadget than on your very own Combat Utility Belt!

 This handy-dandy combat aid comes packed with 4 gadgets to ensure you get a TPK every time.

 ## Reroll Initiative

 The BBEG rolled a 2 for initiative? Not anymore! This gadget rerolls initiative for all combatants each round.

 Glorious chaos!

 ## Hide NPC Names

 [hide npc names animation]

 Maybe you forgot that your NPC's name reveals a dark secret about their past, or maybe you forgot to give them a name.

 Fret no more, for this gadget replaces NPC names with a replacement of your choice. Personally, I'm a fan of Melvin.

 ## Enhanced Conditions

 [enhanced conditions animation]

 It's not enough to *show* your players when their poisoned, you want to really drive it  home by linking the condition so they can wallow in misery as they fail their ability checks.

 This gadget creates a dynamo-powered link between token status icons and journal entries with further info on that status effect.

 ### Condition Lab

 In here you can mix up your ~~dastardly~~ heroic combination of status icons and condition names.

 I like the Deadly STD one!

 ## Mark Injured/Dead Tokens

 [mark injured dead tokens animation]

 Ack! Gasp! I'm bloodied! What does that even mean? Who knows?!

 Well, now *you* do! With this gadget you can define a threshold (% of hp) that marks a token as injured. This gadget can also mark tokens as dead when their hp reaches 0. Outstanding! Now my players will have no doubt that I am the most ~~evil~~ heroic GM there was!
